# hello-world
Just another repository 

Hi people!

I am new to github and am trying to learn how to use it so that I can post projects up for employers to see. I am graduating in December 2019 with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science. My favorite programming language is Python, but I am also familiar with C++, Java, and JavaScript/HTML.
